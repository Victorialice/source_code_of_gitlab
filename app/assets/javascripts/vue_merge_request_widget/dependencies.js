/**
 * This file is the centerpiece of an attempt to reduce potential conflicts
 * between the CE and EE versions of the MR widget. EE additions to the MR widget should
 * be contained in the ee/vue_merge_request_widget directory, and should **extend**
 * rather than mutate CE MR Widget code.
 *
 * This file should be the only source of conflicts between EE and CE. EE-only components should
 * imported directly where they are needed, and import paths for EE extensions of CE components
 * should overwrite import paths **without** changing the order of dependencies listed here.
