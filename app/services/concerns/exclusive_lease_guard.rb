#
# Concern that helps with getting an exclusive lease for running a block
# of code.
#
# `#try_obtain_lease` takes a block which will be run if it was able to
# obtain  the lease. Implement `#lease_timeout` to configure the timeout
# for the exclusive lease. Optionally override `#lease_key` to set the
# lease key, it defaults to the class name with underscores.
