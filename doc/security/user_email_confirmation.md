# User email confirmation at sign-up

Gitlab admin can enable email confirmation on sign-up, if you want to confirm all
user emails before they are able to sign-in.

In the Admin area under **Settings** (`/admin/application_settings`), go to section
**Sign-in Restrictions** and look for **Send confirmation email on sign-up** option.
