## GitLab UI development kit

We created a page inside GitLab where you can check commonly used html and css elements.

When you run GitLab instance locally - just visit http://localhost:3000/help/ui page to see UI examples
you can use during GitLab development.

## Design repository

All design files are stored in the [gitlab-design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design)
repository and maintained by GitLab UX designers.

## [brand.ai](https://brand.ai/git-lab/primary-brand)

We are in the process of capturing our UI paradigms on brand.ai, see https://brand.ai/git-lab/primary-brand
