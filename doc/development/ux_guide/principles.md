# Principles

These are the guiding principles that we should strive for to establish a solid foundation for the GitLab experience.

## Professional and productive
GitLab is a tool to support what people do, day in, day out. We need to respect the importance of their work, and avoid gimicky details.

## Minimal and efficient
While work can get complicated, GitLab is about bringing a sharp focus, helping our customers know what matters now.

## Immediately recognizable
When you look at any screen, you should know immediately that it is GitLab. Our personality is strong and consistent across product and marketing experiences.

## Human and quirky
We need to build empathy with our users, understanding their state of mind, and connect with them at a human level. Quirkiness is part of our DNA, and we should embrace it in the right moments and contexts.
