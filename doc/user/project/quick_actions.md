# GitLab quick actions

Quick actions are textual shortcuts for common actions on issues or merge
requests that are usually done by clicking buttons or dropdowns in GitLab's UI.
You can enter these commands while creating a new issue or merge request, and
in comments. Each command should be on a separate line in order to be properly
detected and executed. The commands are removed from the issue, merge request or
comment body before it is saved and will not be visible to anyone else.

Below is a list of all of the available commands and descriptions about what they
do.
