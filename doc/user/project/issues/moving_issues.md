# Moving Issues

Please read through the [GitLab Issue Documentation](index.md) for an overview on GitLab Issues.

Moving an issue will close it and duplicate it on the specified project.
There will also be a system note added to both issues indicating where it came from or went to.

You can move an issue with the "Move issue" button at the bottom of the right-sidebar when viewing the issue.
