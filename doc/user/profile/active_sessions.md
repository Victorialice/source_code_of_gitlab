# Active Sessions

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/17867)
>   in GitLab 10.8.

GitLab lists all devices that have logged into your account. This allows you to
review the sessions and revoke any of it that you don't recognize.

## Listing all active sessions

1. On the upper right corner, click on your avatar and go to your **Settings**.
1. Navigate to the **Active Sessions** tab.

## Revoking a session

1. Navigate to your [profile's](#profile-settings) **Settings > Active Sessions**.
1. Click on **Revoke** besides a session. The current session cannot be
   revoked, as this would sign you out of GitLab.
