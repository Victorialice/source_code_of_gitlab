# Browser Performance Testing with the Sitespeed.io container

This example shows how to run the
[Sitespeed.io container](https://hub.docker.com/r/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/) on
your code by using GitLab CI/CD and [Sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io)
using Docker-in-Docker.

First, you need a GitLab Runner with the
[docker-in-docker executor](../docker/using_docker_build.md#use-docker-in-docker-executor).
Once you set up the Runner, add a new job to `.gitlab-ci.yml`, called
`performance`:

```yaml
performance:
  stage: performance
  image: docker:git
  variables:
    URL: https://example.com
  services:
    - docker:stable-dind
  script:
    - mkdir gitlab-exporter
    - wget -O ./gitlab-exporter/index.js https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-performance/raw/master/index.js
    - mkdir sitespeed-results
    - docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:6.3.1 --plugins.add ./gitlab-exporter --outputFolder sitespeed-results $URL
    - mv sitespeed-results/data/performance.json performance.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - performance.json
    - sitespeed-results/
```

The above example will:

1. Create a `performance` job in your CI/CD pipeline and will run
   Sitespeed.io against the webpage you defined in `URL`.
1. The [GitLab plugin](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-performance) for
   Sitespeed.io is downloaded in order to export key metrics to JSON. The full
   HTML Sitespeed.io report will also be saved as an artifact, and if you have
   [GitLab Pages](../../user/project/pages/index.md) enabled, it can be viewed
   directly in your browser.

For further customization options of Sitespeed.io, including the ability to
provide a list of URLs to test, please consult
[their documentation](https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/sitespeed.io/configuration/).

TIP: **Tip:**
For [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) users, key metrics are automatically
extracted and shown right in the merge request widget. Learn more about
[Browser Performance Testing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.html).

## Performance testing on Review Apps

The above CI YML is great for testing against static environments, and it can
be extended for dynamic environments. There are a few extra steps to take to
set this up:

1. The `performance` job should run after the dynamic environment has started.
1. In the `review` job, persist the hostname and upload it as an artifact so
   it's available to the `performance` job (the same can be done for static
   environments like staging and production to unify the code path). Saving it
   as an artifact is as simple as `echo $CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL > environment_url.txt`
   in your job's `script`.
1. In the `performance` job, read the previous artifact into an environment
   variable, like `$CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL`, and use it to parameterize the test
   URLs.
1. You can now run the Sitespeed.io container against the desired hostname and
   paths.

Your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file would look like:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy
  - performance

review:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    url: http://$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG.$APPS_DOMAIN
  script:
    - run_deploy_script
    - echo $CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL > environment_url.txt
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - environment_url.txt
  only:
    - branches
  except:
    - master

performance:
  stage: performance
  image: docker:git
  services:
    - docker:stable-dind
  dependencies:
    - review
  script:
    - export CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL=$(cat environment_url.txt)
    - mkdir gitlab-exporter
    - wget -O ./gitlab-exporter/index.js https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-performance/raw/master/index.js
    - mkdir sitespeed-results
    - docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v "$(pwd)":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:6.3.1 --plugins.add ./gitlab-exporter --outputFolder sitespeed-results "$CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL"
    - mv sitespeed-results/data/performance.json performance.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - performance.json
      - sitespeed-results/
```
