# GitLab Continuous Integration (GitLab CI/CD)

![Pipeline graph](img/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png)

The benefits of Continuous Integration are huge when automation plays an
integral part of your workflow. GitLab comes with built-in Continuous
Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery support
to build, test, and deploy your application.

Here's some info we've gathered to get you started.

## Getting started

The first steps towards your GitLab CI/CD journey.

- [Getting started with GitLab CI/CD](quick_start/README.md): understand how GitLab CI/CD works.
- [GitLab CI/CD configuration file: `.gitlab-ci.yml`](yaml/README.md) - Learn all about the ins and outs of `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- [Pipelines and jobs](pipelines.md): configure your GitLab CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy your application.
- Runners: The [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is responsible by running the jobs in your CI/CD pipeline. On GitLab.com, Shared Runners are enabled by default, so
you don't need to set up anything to start to use them with GitLab CI/CD.
